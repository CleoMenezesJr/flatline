### Load the extension in Firefox

1. Clone the repository
2. Open Firefox browser and navigate to `about:debugging`
3. Click "Load Temporary Add-on" and from the file browser, choose `manifest.json`

## The Why

To facilitate the installation process of Flatpak applications through the websites flathub.org/ and app.gnome.org, I created this simple extension that, through appstream, opens GNOME Software directly in the app's details panel.
